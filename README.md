# Machine-Learning-Playground

This repository will host code that I write as I experiment with ML libraries and methods.

In a sense, this repo will document my learning with regards to Machine Learning in Python. This will be fuelled by personal reading and well as Udemy classes I peruse. I hope to use this repo as a point of reference for future work. A refresher of sorts!

All files will be rendered in Jupyter Notebooks and will contain extensive commentary as I walk through my thought process.

For those who stumble across this repo - I hope this helps and enjoy!

Lot's of examples taken from Intro to ML with Python, Udemy, Superdatascience, stackoverflow etc.
